# PokeGuesser - PokeAPI utilizing guessing game  

PokeGuesser is a game in the spirit of "Who's That Pokemon"! It utilizes PokeAPI's sprites as well as info about the sprites to make a comprehensive hint list and blurred image / silhouette! I've had a lot of fun making this project for Hack Club's 2025 "Summer of Making", and this'll be my first project I've completed.
